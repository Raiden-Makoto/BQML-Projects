# BQML Projects
**I'm learning BigQuery SQL + BigQueryML + Looker so I (hopefully) can finally get a DS/ML job**

## List of Projects

### NYC Taxi
Simple exploratory dataset analysis practice using Python and BigQuery SQL on the `NYC_Taxi` dataset.
Familiarized myself with the BigQuery Web UI and basic processes like creating datasets, cloning datasets, and simple IAM

Predicting the mass of penguins based on data such as species, sex, flipper length, and geographic location.
